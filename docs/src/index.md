# GrapheneQFT.jl
## Overview
[GrapheneQFT.jl](https://github.com/rodin-physics/GrapheneQFT.jl) is an extendable package written in the Julia programming language that facilitates the field theoretic treatment of impurities on monolayer graphene. It is designed to provide a user-friendly interface to calculate a variety of experimentally relevant QFT quantities in graphene in the presence of external perturbations. We hope that this package makes QFT formalism more approachable and promotes greater research progress by providing users with a readily available computational framework.
